This page tracks the changes in popularity of the Matlab and Python programming languages.

One difficulty in comparing these languages is that Python is versatile, and
has many uses outside science and data analysis.  For example, it is widely
used in web programming.  However, it seems that recent growth in Python has
been driven by its use in data analysis - see [Why is Python growing so
quickly](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly). The
following is a quote from that page:

> These analyses suggest two conclusions. First, the fastest-growing use of
> Python is for data science, machine learning and academic research. This is
> particularly visible in the growth of the pandas package, which is the
> fastest-growing Python-related tag on the site. As for which industries are
> using Python, we found that it is more visited in a few industries, such as
> electronics, manufacturing, software, government, and especially
> universities. However, Pythonâ€™s growth is spread pretty evenly across
> industries.

To get at different uses of Python, some of the metrics below include searches
/ uses of the Pandas data science library for Python.  It seems reasonable to
presume that people searching for the Pandas library, or asking questions
about it, are some subset of those using Python for data analysis, rather
than, say, web programming.

Some of the metrics below also include searches / questions about the R programming language.  This is another baseline to capture another major player in data analysis.

Other metrics include values for Java.  Java has been, and by some metrics,
still is, the most popular programming language overall.

## Google searches

Here are the [Google trends](https://trends.google.com) data for Matlab, Python, Pandas and R:

Matlab searches are in very slow decline.  Python searches started ticking up
around 2011, and have been steadily increasing.  From mid 2015 Python searches
have been increasing at something like a linear rate of about 13% of peak per
year.  Searches for Pandas, the Python library, are at about half the rate for
all searches for Matlab, the programming language, and are also growing
quickly.

I previously combined the search term "data science" with Python and Matlab:

Matlab hardly registers in this search, compared to Python.

## Redmonk Programming Language Rankings / Stack Overflow

See a [previous post]({filename}/hows-julia.ipynb) for an introduction to the
[Redmonk ratings](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/category/programming-languages).

* [June 2019 ratings](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2019/07/18/language-rankings-6-19);
* [Q1 2019 rankings](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2019/03/20/language-rankings-1-19);
* [Q3 2018 rankings](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/08/10/language-rankings-6-18).

| Year | Quarter | Python position | Matlab position |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2019 | 3       | 3               | 23              |
| 2019 | 1       | 3               | <20             |
| 2018 | 3       | 3               | <20             |

Some data for the Redmonk rankings come from [Stack Overflow
data](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends).  Here are the
percentages of Stack Overflow questions on Python, Java, R, Matlab, and Pandas.

Here is a plot restricted to Matlab and Pandas, to show more detail:

![](images/so_pandas_matlab.png)

Matlab appears to have gone into relative decline from around the middle of
\2015, at about the same time that Pandas started its rapid ascent.  There are
now in the order of 10 times more questions about Pandas, the Python library,
than there are about Matlab, the language.

## Popularity of Programming Languages site

This graphic is a screen shot from the [PopularitY of Programming Languages](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) website:

![](images/pypl_java_matlab_python_r.png)

Notice the logarithmic scale.  Python recently replaced Java as the most
popular language of any type.  Matlab is in slow decline, with the rate of
decline picking up around 2015.  Python's "share" on this graph is around
29.9%; Matlab's share is more than ten times less at 1.8%.

## Percentage of all Github pull requests

The [Githut 2.0 site](https://madnight.github.io/githut) has the percentage of
all Github pull requests that are in a particular language.  This reflects
open-source development activity.  As of the fourth quarter of 2019, these
values were:

* Python: 17.6% (2nd position overall, after JavaScript).
* R: 0.12% (31st position).
* Matlab: 0.06% (37th).

## TIOBE language index

See the [previous post]({filename}/hows-julia.ipynb) for an introduction to
the TIOBE index.  The plots here from links to the various languages at
<https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index>.

![](images/tiobe_python_2020.png)

![](images/tiobe_matlab_2020.png)

![](images/tiobe_r_2020.png)

Notice the scales for these plots; the peak values for Python, Matlab and R
are around 10%, 2% and 2.5% respectively, with Matlab and R peaking around
2017.  Python appears to be on a steady upward trend from the beginning of
2018.

The positions of Python, Matlab and R in the Tiobe rankings are 3rd, 16th and
13th respectively, as of writing (February 2020).

TED talks on vulnerability, shame and courage\
\
I was moved by the description of the \'wholehearted\' people that Brené
Brown describes in her first TED talk
: <http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html>\
 \
Her second talk is about shame, and the damage it does
: <http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame.html>\
\
It can be hard to be an academic; we judge and are judged on our public
work and our public speaking.  We can be publicly wrong and publicly
dumb.  We want our smart students to ask dumb questions so they can
learn, but we do not have the courage to do this ourselves.\
\
Brené Brown talks about the nature of shame and of vulnerability, and in
doing so, shows courage.  The talks give me hope that I will be brave
enough to be more vulnerable, and better at resisting shame.

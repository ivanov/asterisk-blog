\"I fully agree with you about the significance and educational value of
methodology as well as history and philosophy of science. So many people
today --- and even professional scientists --- seem to me like someone
who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge
of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of
independence from prejudices of his generation from which most
scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical
insight is --- in my opinion --- the mark of distinction between a mere
artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth.\"\

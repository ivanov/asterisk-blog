\
Results for standard neuroimaging analysis pipelines differ somewhat
when run on two very similar Redhat-based Intel Linux clusters. Â The
conclusion was that these differences were due in part to differences in
single precision (32-bit) floating point.\
\
The authors say: \"A first step to correct these reproducibility issues
would be to use more precise representations of floating-point numbers
\... \"\
\
Another conclusion might be that the results are inherently numerical
unstable if they really rely on minutiae of floating point
implementation.\
\
The differences would surely have been greater comparing really
different operating systems like Windows and OSX.

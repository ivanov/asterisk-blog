Summary: NetBSD developers on death by leadership vacuum
---

My friend [Paul Ivanov](http://pirsquared.org) kindly pointed me to this
[Self-interview after leaving the NetBSD
board](http://julipedia.meroh.net/2013/06/self-interview-after-leaving-netbsd.html) by Julio Merino.

This lead me to an earlier [NetBSD resignation
email](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/2006/08/30/0016.html) from
Charles Hannum, one of the "4 originators of NetBSD".

They both complain of lack of leadership.  From Merino's post:

> [the "core" and "board of directors"] teams are dysfunctional because they
> do not provide leadership: all they do is act reactively to requests from
> users and/or to resolve internal disputes. In other words: there is no
> initiative nor vision emerging from these teams (and, for that matter, from
> anybody).

From Hannum:

> There is no high-level direction; if you ask "what about the problems with
> threads" or "will there be a flash-friendly file system", the best you'll
> get is "we'd love to have both" -- but no work is done to recruit people to
> code these things, or encourage existing developers to work on them.

Merino also complains that the NetBSD leadership will not take risks:

> As things are today, the project leaders will almost always settle for
> either the conservative solution or a solution that compromises on every
> detail so as to not annoy anyone. Unfortunately, this approach implicitly
> disappoints a group of people â€” a group of people that may not be vocal
> enough to express their preferences out of previous disappointments. All of
> this, of course, only happens when the leader teams are asked about
> something, as they will rarely provide input unless asked for (see reactive
> model above).

Hannum wonders aloud whether the diffuse management structure is the problem:

> Much of this early structure (CVS, web site, cabal ["core" group], etc.) was
> copied verbatim by other open source (this term not being in wide use yet)
> projects -- even the form of the project name and the term "core".  This
> later became a kind of standard template for starting up an open source
> project. [...] I'm sorry to say that I helped create this problem, and that
> most of the projects which modeled themselves after NetBSD (probably due to
> its high popularity in 1993 and 1994) have suffered similar problems.
> FreeBSD and XFree86, for example, have both forked successor projects
> (Dragonfly and X.org) for very similar reasons.>

Hannum wanted a change in leadership:

> 1) There must be a strong leadership, and it is not the current one.
>  The leadership must honestly want NetBSD to be a premier, world class
>  system with leading edge features.  The leadership must set
>  aggressive goals, and actively recruit people to make them happen.

and:

> I must repeat a point I've made earlier.  The current "management" of the
> project is not going to either fix the project's problems, or lead the
> project to solutions.  They are going to maintain the status quo, and
> nothing else.  If the project is to rise from its charred stump, this
> "management" must be disbanded and replaced wholesale.  Anything less is a
> non-solution.

\"The work on satisfactory formulation of technical patents was a true
blessing for me. It compelled me to be many-sided in thought, and also
offered important stimulation for thought about physics. Following a
practical profession is a blessing for people of my type. Because the
academic career puts a young person in a sort of compulsory situation to
produce scientific papers in impressive quantity, a temptation to
superficiality arises that only strong characters are able to resist.\"\

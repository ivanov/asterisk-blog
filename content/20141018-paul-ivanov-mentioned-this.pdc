Paul Ivanov mentioned this talk in his Scipy presentation.\
\
The main idea that struck me was the idea of writing software that can
make it easier to think about your task as you do it. Â He gave the
example of Kasparov beating Deep Blue when he could himself use a
computer to suggest ideas for moves, and he showed an example of making
music using very short scripts in Clojure.

Summary: Bad smells from New Testament studies

A few years ago I read the last book written by [John A. T.
Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robinson_(bishop_of_Woolwich)):
"The priority of John" (1985).

It is an interesting book, and encouraging.  Robinson reflects on the details
of the stories and the timeline in John, and argues that the sources must be
close to the events; as close or closer than the sources of the synoptic
gospels.

Stirred, I started to read some other books with the same theme.  The books I
am going to write about here are:

* "Jesus and Judaism" (1985) by E. P. Saunders, ISBN 0-8006-2061-5 (JaJ);
* "Jesus within Judaism" (1988) by James H. Charlesworth, ISBN 0-385-23610-7 (JwJ);
* "Excavating Jesus" (2001) (revised and updated) by John Dominic Crossan and
  Jonathan L. Reed, ISBN 0-06-061634-2 (EJ).

When I was reading Robinson's book, I felt that I was listening to a
thoughtful man, well-read in the history and criticism of the Gospels, but
thinking beside and around that tradition.  Robinson seemed serious in his
desire to know what had happened, and how to think about it, from the
documents we have.

Maybe this was also what it was like to talk with Robinson. In the preface of
JaJ, E. P. Saunders writes : "My dearest memories of 1982 are the evenings
spent in his [Robinson's] rooms discussing my work and his. [...] Here I can
only say that my life and work were greatly enhanced by him".

I was hoping to have the same pleasure from reading JaJ, JwJ and EJ, but these
books were hard to read. I gave up on Saunders' book about a quarter of the
way through, for reasons I'll describe.  I read all of Charlesworth's book,
but felt rather miserable and tired when I finished it.  I'm still reading
"Excavating Jesus" but I often find myself skipping passages and snorting like
a buffalo.

The reason these books are hard to read, is that they appear to be addressed
to a sensibility I do not share.  I wanted to hear the evidence, and consider
it carefully.  But these books evoke too much of their authors' worlds to be
comfortable.  As with many bad books, I started to feel embarrassed to be
looking at something public that should be private.

## Jesus and Judaism (JaJ)

From the introduction, page 2:

> To speak personally for a moment, I am interested in the debate about the
> significance of the historical Jesus for theology in the way one is
> interested in something that he once found fascinating.  The present work is
> written without that question in mind, however, and those who wish an essay
> on that topic may put this book down and proceed further along the shelf.

Why did Saunder's write that?   It was odd enough that Charlesworth quotes
this section in a footnote, introducing the quote with "Note how he maligns
theology" (footnote 8, page 28).  Why the slap-down for those who "wish an
essay on that topic"?  The passage seems too personal, too irritable.  It
makes one worry.

Then the book develops its argument, which starts with the famous incident
where Jesus drives the money-changers out of the temple:

> On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out
> those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the
> money changers and the benches of those selling doves, and would not allow
> anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.  And as he taught
> them, he said, "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of
> prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"
>
> -- <cite>Mark 11: 15-17, New International Version (NIV)</cite>

John's description of the same event ends with:

> His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will
> consume me." (John 2:17 NIV).

The traditional interpretation of that passage, if you can call it an
interpretation, is that Jesus was purifying the temple from unclean commerce.
Saunder's doesn't believe that, because "the principal function of any temple
is to serve as a place of sacrifice, and [...] sacrifices *require* the supply
of suitable animals" (p. 63). "The business arrangements around the temple
were *necessary* if the commandments were to be obeyed" (p. 65). He has little
patience for the "purifying" interpretation of his fellow scholars and the
authors of the Gospel passages: "Just what would be left of the service if the
supposedly corrupting externalism of sacrifices, and the trade necessary to
them, were purged?  Here as often we see the failure to think concretely and a
preference for vague religious abstractions" (p.63).  The silly idea of
purification is a modern one: "New Testament scholars who write about Jesus'
concern for the purity of the temple seem to have in mind a familiar
Protestant idea: 'Pure' worship consists in the Word, and all external rites
should be purged" (p. 67-8).  Saunders' own interpretation of the event is
that "Jesus' action is to be regarded as a symbolic demonstration [...] it
symbolized destruction". (p. 69, 70).  "We should suppose that Jesus *knew
what he was doing*: like others, he regarded the sacrifices as commanded by
God, he knew that they required a certain amount of trade, and he knew that
making a gesture toward disrupting the trade represented an attack on the
divinely ordained sacrifices" (p. 70). (all italics in quotes are in the
original).

There are some obvious objections.  First is that the traditional
interpretation appears in the passage itself - "But you have made it 'a den of
robbers'".  Saunders rejects that passage as a later interpolation.  Even if
it is, presumably that was the dominant interpretation in the first few
centuries, so it doesn't seem likely that this interpretation was absurd to
its audience, as it seems to be for Saunders.

Another objection is the one Saunders gives on p. 70: "Professor Moule has
proposed to me that overturning one or more tables is not a self-evident
symbol of destruction [...] Would breaking something not have been a better
symbol?.  Perhaps so".

Saunders is making a case.  It's not a convincing case, and he's making it too
strongly.  He dismisses his opponents on the way.  Why does he do this?  What
does he gain?  Who is he writing for?

At this point I got cross. I didn't think that I was going to gain much
myself, and I went on to the slightly later book by Charlesworth.

## Jesus within Judaism

This book was easier for me to read, but I was often uncomfortable.  It's a
little difficult to characterize why, but there were some obvious triggers.
The major one was a degree of pandering.  It takes the form of setting the
record straight, of putting weight on the opposite side of a balance, but that
means that the argument in the book, independent of the error it is trying to
correct, is - out of balance.

> Centuries before the medieval craftsmen, the prayers of Jews were
> denigrated. [...] The vision was distorted. It is time to acknowledge these
> failures. [...]. A virtually unparalleled confession of unworthiness and of
> sinfulness is found in the Prayer of Manesseh. Two verses should be quoted:
>
>     And now behold I am bending the knees of my heart before you;
>     And I am beseeching your kindness;
>     I have sinned O Lord, I have sinned;
>     But I certainly know my sins.
>     (Vss 11-12 from the Syr.)
>
> The author of this work must not be dismissed as a miserable wretch, or a
> Jew who has committed sins.  He was conscious of his infirmities, and he
> confessed the weaknesses that any introspective person sees daily. The
> author was a devout Jew and a near contemporary of Jesus.
>
> JwJ pp 47-48.

What Charlesworth does not mention, is that the [Prayer of
Manesseh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_of_Manasseh) is written as from
the mouth of one of the most wretched of all the kings of Judah, condemned in
[2 Kings 21:1-17](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b21.htm): "Moreover
Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one
end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that
which was evil in the sight of the LORD."  [2 Chronicles
33:12-13](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b33.htm#12) describes his
abject repentance: "And when he was in distress, he besought the LORD his God,
and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.  And he prayed unto
Him; and He was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him
back to Jerusalem into his kingdom."

Later in the same section we have:

> [Jesus] probably taught his disciples a special prayer, which is
> recognizable in the Lord's Prayer, said regularly by Christians today.
> Jesus' prayer is strikingly similar to Jewish prayers, especially the
> Qaddish, and his appeal to God to 'forgive our debts as we also forgive our
> debtors' is not a 'Christian' invention, but a Jewish tradition reflected,
> for example, in the Prayer of Manasseh.
>
> JwJ, p 50.

The Prayer of Manesseh is not particularly obscure; it reached the [King James
Bible as part of the
Apocrypha](http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Prayer-of-Manasseh-Chapter-1);
Martin Luther included it in his 74-book translation of the Bible.  It's also
pretty short.  I don't know about you, but I can't see any reference to the
need to forgive my debtors in that prayer.  There are certainly similar
phrases between the Lord's Prayer and the [Mourning
Kaddish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish), ("May He establish His
kingdom", "from the Father who is in heaven (and earth)"), but nothing that I
can see about forgiving our debtors.

I don't find it hard to believe that forgiving those who sin against me was a
common feature of 1st century Jewish prayer, but, if Charlesworth is taking
his readers seriously, surely he should give some evidence for that.

## Excavating Jesus

The authors of EJ are a Biblical scholar (Crossman) and a New Testament
archaeologist (Reed).

> The purpose of this book is to integrate the archeology of ground and the
> exegesis of gospel by giving each its full explanatory power and by refusing
> to privilege one over the other [...] If an ancient site is a series of
> superimposed dwellings, an ancient gospel is a similar series of
> superimposed overwritings.  In both cases, therefore, multiple layering is
> the absolutely fundamental challenge to be faced.
>
> EJ pp xvii-xix.

There are a few problems.  The first is that the book is rather overwritten,
and the metaphor of physical and textual layers quickly becomes tiring.  There
is some pandering.  The authors seem to trust their own judgment a great
further than the information allows.

Chapter 2 is called "Layers upon layers upon layers".  It starts off with a
summary of the archeology of the town of Nazareth.  Nazareth at the time of
Jesus appears to have been a peasant village of a few hundred people.  Formal
synagogue buildings were rare in the region in the first century [^magdala],
although "In places like Nazareth there were no doubt synagogues in the sense
of village gatherings and assemblies". "Best specific work on ancient literacy
in the Jewish homeland concludes about a 3 percent literacy rate".  With this
background, the two writers consider the story in Luke 4:16-30:

[^magdala]: In 2013, [archaeologists found a first century synagogue in
Magdala](http://www.pri.org/stories/2013-01-04/israeli-archeologists-discover-jesus-synagogue),
a fishing village on the shores of Lake Galilee.

> He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he
> went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the
> scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him.  Unrolling it, he found the
> place where it is written: “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has
> anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim
> freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the
> oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.” Then he rolled up
> the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone
> in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, “Today
> this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” All spoke well of him and were
> amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's
> son?" they asked.  Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb
> to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your
> hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’” “Truly I tell you,”
> he continued, “no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure you that
> there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for
> three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.
> Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the
> region of Sidon. And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of
> Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed — only Naaman the
> Syrian.” All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
> They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill
> on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he
> walked right through the crowd and went on his way.

The books explains the possible "layers" of gospel text - "Layer I contains
materials that go back to the historical Jesus in the late 20s. [...] Layer II
contains materials either adopted from that earlier layer or else created by
or within the ongoing tradition. [...]".  Layer III has three "sub-layers"
with the first being the Q Gospel and Mark; the second "most probably
dependent on these two preceding gospels, contains Matthew and Luke, from the
80s.  The third [sub-] level, quite possibly dependent on Mark, Matthew and
Luke, is the gospel of John.  That canonical process is, by the way, our most
secure evidence for layering as a gospel phenomenon" (p. 74).

Then the authors argue that Luke made up the whole story from beginning to
end:

> With Luke 4:16-30 above, the conclusion was not just that early
> first-century Nazareth had no synagogue building, no scrolls of Law and
> Prophets, no literate and learned peasants, no nearby cliff, but also, and
> more important, no murderous inhabitants.  Jesus' home villagers had never
> attempted to kill him.  The story came, not from the original level of
> Stratum I, but from the Lukan level of stratum IIIb.  That conclusion is
> worth the trouble, not only for the historical accuracy, but also for the
> honor and dignity of a tiny Jewish hamlet in a small country long, long ago.
> Jesus did not grow up in a village of killers.
>
> EJ p. 73

Is the strength of this conclusion justified?

For the synagogue, Luke does not claim a large formal building, and the
authors have already agreed that some kind of synagogue meeting was likely.

The synagogue meeting requires readings from the law and the prophets.  Alan
Millard ([^r-and-r-tj]) estimates that a long scroll of Isaiah would have cost
around a week of a casual laborer's wages.

[^r-and-r-tj]: Alan Millard, "Reading and Writing in the Time of Jesus" Vol.
69. NYU Press, 2000, p 165.

The calculation of 3% literacy among Jews in first-century Palestine is based
on very flimsy evidence.  You can read the main evidence that Crossan cites in
more detail elsewhere at [this web copy of the article](
https://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/illitera.html).  Even if that were not so,
the 3% figure isn't very useful in estimating how likely it was that Jesus
could read.

If I selected a 30 year old man from the USA at random, and asked you to guess
whether he had a degree in philosophy, you'd guess no.  You'd guess no because
you would find that [40 percent of working age Americans have a
degree](http://strongernation.luminafoundation.org/report/2016), and [0.5% of
US degrees are philosophy
degrees](http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatorDoc.aspx?d=56&hl=philosophy&m=0).
If I selected a working-age American male at random, he has about a 2 in 1000
chance of having a philosophy degree.  Now imagine I tell you that the person
I have selected is a well-known teacher of philosophy.  You are now interested
in the proportion of successful teachers of philosophy with a degree in
philosophy.  You might guess this proportion was somewhere over 50%, so about
250 times higher than your original estimate.   See [this blog
post](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/bibleandculture/2011/11/02/reading-and-writing-in-herodian-israel-was-jesus-an-illiterate-peasant-part-one)
for a summary of the evidence that Jesus had a detailed knowledge of the
scriptures.

Last: "no nearby cliff".  If you, like me, were entirely ignorant of the
geography of Nazareth, you might presume from the authors' strong feelings on
this matter that Nazareth is pretty flat.  If so, the [Israeli tourist board
disagrees with
you](http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Tourist%20Information/Discover%20Israel/Cities/Pages/Nazareth.aspx):

> Nazareth, in the lower Galilee, is located in the heart of a valley
> surrounded by mountains.

You can check it out on Google earth and Google maps to get an idea.  In fact,
Nazareth has, as Luke says, some significant slopes, including the site
traditionally associated with the end of Luke's story, called [Mount
Precipice](http://www.nazarethinfo.org/en/attractions/attractions/mount-precipice).

So, Crossan and Reed could reasonably have said something like: "there is some
chance that there was no scroll to read from; there is some chance that Jesus
could not read; the nearby slopes don't seem quite dangerous enough for us to
believe the Nazarenes could really have believed that they could kill Jesus by
throwing him down".  But what they actually wrote goes a long way past that.

That brings me back to the question that I found myself asking for all three
of 
three books - who are the authors writing for?  Who is the polemic addressed
to?  Crossan and Reed give a some part of an answer in the text I've already
quoted:

> That conclusion is worth the trouble, not only for the historical accuracy,
> but also for the honor and dignity of a tiny Jewish hamlet in a small
> country long, long ago.

So, if you were previously tempted to condemn these people without good cause,
shame on you, and this book is what you need.  But, if that was not your sin,
and you wanted a careful analysis of the evidence, you'd have to a lot of your
own research to evaluate the arguments in this book.

The Tate Modern exhibits art dating from 1900.  You could
just imagine [Van
Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh) getting in
under the wire, although he died in 1890.  The senior Tory being quoted does
not appear to know anything about
[Reubens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens); he
died in 1640.

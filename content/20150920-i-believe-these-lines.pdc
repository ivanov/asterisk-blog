I believe these lines from the pope\'s homily show a deep understanding
of the way Cubans think of themselves:\
\
\"God's holy and faithful people in Cuba is a people with a taste for
parties, for friendship, for beautiful things. It is a people which
marches with songs of praise. Â It is a people which has its wounds, like
every other people, yet knows how to stand up with open arms, to keep
walking in hope, because it has a vocation of grandeur.\"\
